## ToDo List
- Handle TV Series
  - When an episode is started, its shown with an offset, the season and series are also viewed with playcount being 0
  - When an episode is completed, the season and series are also completed
  - A seen episode marks the season as seen and the show as seen
  - specials
  - test multi-ep series
  - created_at for season  and series = when first episode was ever watched, last_viewed_atand updated_at = when last episdewas watched
  - index = ep no, parent index = season number

- take another stab at changed_at
- video nodes
- Does it work with anidb metadata
